Files needed to generate cardiac diffusion MRI sequences utilizing the MATLAB version of Pulseq

The provided MATLAB code requires the open-source pulse sequence framework Pulseq https://pulseq.github.io/ to run.
The file "directions.mat" contains example diffusion directions but can be replaced with any desired q-space sampling scheme.
No guarantees regarding compatability of generated files with any hardware or the suitability for use on volunteers/phantoms/patients are made.
Special Thanks go to Prof. Dr. Maxim Zaitsev and the rest of the Pulseq team for assisting with development.
